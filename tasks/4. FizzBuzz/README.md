# FizzBuzz

Implement a function that **returns an array** with the **numbers from 1 to n**, but for **multiples of three add 'Fizz'** instead of the number and for the **multiples of five add 'Buzz'** into the array. For numbers which are multiples of **both three and five** add **'FizzBuzz'**.

## Example

```FizzBuzz(100) // returns [1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", 6, 7, ... 13, 14, "FizzBuzz", ... until 100 ]```
