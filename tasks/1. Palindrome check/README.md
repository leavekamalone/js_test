# Palindrome check

Implement a function which **takes in a string**, and **returns true if** the given string is a **palindrome** and **false otherwise**.

* A **palindrome** is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the **same backward as forward**, such as **madam** or **racecar**.
