# Fibonacci(n) - recursive

Implement a **recursive** function, that **takes in a number** and **returns an array** containing the **fibonacci numbers until the n-th**. **Start the sequence with 0**.

* The Fibonacci sequence is a **set of numbers** that starts with a one or a zero, followed by a one, and proceeds based on the rule that **each number** (called a Fibonacci number) **is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers**.
* A function is **recursive**, when it's defined **in terms of itself**.

## Example:

```Fibonacci(7) // returns [0,1,1,2,3,5,8]```

## Tips & Tricks
 * It doesn't make the outer function recursive, if you define and/or call another recursive function inside.
 * Returning these in an array makes it somewhat harder, you should fiddle around with different approaches
