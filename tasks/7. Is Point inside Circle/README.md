# Point is inside Circle

Implement a function **that takes in a Point** and a **Circle**, and **returns true** if the given **Point is within** the area of the **Circle**.

NOTE: We provided you the basic implementation of **Point** and **Circle**. **Feel free to extend these** with your own methods.

## Examples:

* examplePoint: ```Point(3,4)```
* exampleCircle: ```Circle(Point(1,3), 5)```

```exampleCircle.includes(examplePoint) // returns true```

* examplePoint: ```Point(1,1)```
* exampleCircle: ```Circle(Point(4,2), 2)```

```exampleCircle.includes(examplePoint) // returns false```


## Tips & Tricks
 * Think about what does that mean when a point is tangential, and why it should be considered inside the circle.
